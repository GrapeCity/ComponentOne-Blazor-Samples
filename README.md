# ComponentOne Blazor Edition Samples

Use your existing C# programming skills on the server and client with UI components built natively for Blazor. 

This repository contains the samples for [ComponentOne Blazor Edition](https://developer.mescius.com/componentone/blazor-ui-controls). These samples provide complete implementation details for the Blazor control features. They are also included with the full download and install from grapecity.com/componentone. 

The samples reference but do not include the control packages. The control packages can be downloaded from nuget.org.

## Building a Sample 

Blazor samples will require [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) and Visual Studio 2019 and above.

Then run these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample: 

```
dotnet build 
dotnet run 
```

This will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run the project respectively.
